# Vayner Slider Exercise

I ran out of time to work on mobile design, but I would've used min-width breakpoints and stored them in an exported globals object that could be used in any styled components. I also would have done this with colors instead of hardcoding hex codes. I don't have Photoshop on my computer, so pixel measurements are not exact.
